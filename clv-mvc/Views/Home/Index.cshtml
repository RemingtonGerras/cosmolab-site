            USC CosmoLab consists of students, postdocs, staff, and faculty doing research in astrophysics and cosmology.
            We meet weekly to review new papers, discuss progress and current issues related to research and academia, and hack together. You can check out our recent <a href="https://github.com/usc-cosmolab/hackspace">hacks</a> and <a asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Talks">talks</a> schedule and email gluscevi[at]usc.edu if you'd like to join the meetings.
